Its towering presence casts a radiant glow across the land, and its ethereal appearance, marked by its skeletal frame and glowing eye sockets, leaves an indelible impression on all who encounter it. This enigmatic entity wields the sublime power of solar magic with absolute mastery, and its very existence testifies to the astounding depths of celestial power that can be harnessed. In its spectral presence, we witness both the beauty of its once-vibrant plumage, now imbued with radiant light, and the captivating wonder of its solar abilities."

descr "The Archlich of Undying Mastery is an eternal and malevolent entity, a pinnacle of necromantic power and an enduring symbol of death's inexorable dominion. The Archlich's form is a haunting testament to its immortality and unyielding mastery over necromantic arts. Its withered, yet undecayed husk is veiled in tattered, regal robes that have stood the test of time. Its eye sockets emit an eerie, malevolent glow, devoid of life yet radiating the wisdom of countless ages. The upper and lower lips, once susceptible to decay, remain locked in an eternal rictus grin."

descr "In the enigmatic world of Elysium, the Archlich Residual Necromancy Husk stands as a haunting embodiment of the past, a body left behind in the shadow of a godly ascension. Once the vessel of an Archlich of Undying Mastery, it has now been severed from the pinnacle of power, its necromantic mastery reduced, yet it remains a vessel of unique significance. The Archlich Residual Necromancy Husk retains a semblance of its former self, albeit with an air of faded grandeur. Its withered form, still cloaked in tattered, regal robes, is now marked by the toll of its diminished mastery. Hollow eyes, once ablaze with the knowledge of death, now bear a solemn, haunting emptiness. Its movements are simple and hollow, lacking the vigor of its past existence."

This divine Archlich has transcended mortal limitations, ascending to a godly state, wielding the forces of death and cataclysm in tandem. The Abyssal Sovereign's formidable presence is accentuated by its flowing black robe, a garment of dark majesty that sways like an omen of impending doom. Its hollow eye sockets blaze with eerie, ethereal flames, and its visage bears an eternal, ageless quality. Four resplendent wings, as black as the abyss, sprout from its back, evoking an image of an otherworldly harbinger."

classdescr "In the ages long before the arrival of man, Elysium was graced by beings of tremendous power who roamed the land, the unchallenged lords of the yet-unnamed realm. Yet, the echoes of an encroaching Ice Age heralded a time of great change. As the frigid embrace of winter tightened its grip on Elysium, these beings, the Sleeping Ones, chose to withdraw into the earth to slumber, seeking respite from the icy tempest that threatened to engulf their world. ^^ In their somnolence, the Sleeping Ones awaited an unknown destiny. But as time passed and the Ice Age rescinded, new inhabitants ventured into their realm, disturbing the tranquility of these ancient beings, sometimes inviting their wrath. It was amid this tumultuous backdrop that the Witches emerged, drawing upon mystic arts to serve the Frost Queen, the embodiment of winter's majesty. ^^ A supremely powerful Witch can use her enigmatic powers to pierce through the plane of Elysium and contact the Frost Queen. Forming a covenant with the powerful Diety of Frozen Majesty, and gaining new powers and followers as a result. ^^ The beings at the Witch's disposal are physically strong and easy to obtain, but most lack ranged attacks.  Archers are a crucial supplement.  The Witch's ability to collect fungi from forests, jungles, and swamps provides her with excellent scouting capabilities.  The more fungi she uses for summoning monsters, the greater the chance of controlling the summoned creature. It is prudent to use plenty of fungi when summoning an Old One, for they are very dangerous if angered."
classabdescr "Witches collect fungi from forests, Jungles and marshes.^Witches can use fungi to perform magic rituals.^Witch's Apprentices can use the surrounding swamps and marshes to recruit Androphags which can then be upgraded at a Citadel.^Poison Archers and Lizard Cavalry can also be recruited by also spending fungi.^Powerful Witches can form covenants with the Frost Queen, the Icy Diety beyond the realms of Elysium, gaining power, allies, snow movement and water breathing."

Much like her predecessor, the Ice Witch, she carries a reputation that sends shivers down the spines of both children and adults. As the Frost Sorceress, she is a formidable force of elemental magic, presiding over the winter landscapes with an air of majesty and enigma. Parents in Elysium continue to invoke her name as a cautionary tale to keep wayward children in check, for her legend remains a potent source of fear. Formed from the Covenant with the Frost Queen and the promise to resurrect the diety, the Hag transformed into a Frost Sorceress and gained massive power."

descr "In the mystical realm of Elysium, the Frost Queen's Chosen stands as a figure of unparalleled power and divine significance. This exalted being is the living embodiment of the chilling embrace of winter, a conduit between the mortal world and the divine. The very mention of their name sends shivers down the spines of both children and adults, for the Frost Queen's Chosen is both feared and revered in equal measure. This figure is often regarded as a demi-god, chosen by the Frost Queen herself to be a living testament to the majesty of the winter season.  As a figure of awe and reverence, the Frost Queen's Chosen is the focal point of tales and legends, a living symbol of the enduring power of winter in Elysium."

descr "Just like knights hunt the Fire Dragons in our part of the realm, barbarians in the northern wastes will try to hunt down their fabled Frost Dragons. In stark contrast to the Fire Dragon's diet of bold knights, the northern barbarians are less of a treat for the Frost Dragons. This is most likely due to their custom of smearing themselves with thick layers of rancid seal blubber to protect against the cold. The Frost Dragon’s lair is often found by observing a large amount of dead warriors frozen solid in various poses. This particular Frost Dragon was bred by the Frost Queen and is indeed one of her pets. As unfathomable as that is to believe. Some say these Dragons have frozen even their ability to age and have gained the ability regenerate minor wounds."
