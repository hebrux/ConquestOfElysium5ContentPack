selectmonster "Queen of the Sea"
descr "In the annals of Elysium's ancient lore, Thalassa, Queen of the Sea, stands as one of the three Elemental Queens of Water, born from the primordial depths of the Elemental Plane of Water at the Dawn of Time. Revered as the progenitors of all elemental beings, these queens embody the essence of their element, each representing a unique aspect of its power.^^Thalassa, with her dominion over the vast and tumultuous sea, commands respect and fear alike. Known for her fickle and unpredictable nature, she holds sway over the crashing waves and treacherous currents that define her realm. Coastal settlements and ships that dare to venture into her domain risk destruction at her hand, for her wrath knows no bounds.^^Yet, amidst her tempestuous rule, Thalassa harbors a secret of profound consequence. Deep within the unfathomable depths of her aqueous kingdom lies the 'Cage of Divinity', a prison wrought by the combined might of the Elemental Queens. Within its icy confines, they have ensnared the Frost Queen, their eldest sister, and the mightiest of the 4. Draining her Immense Elemental powers and casting her into an eternal slumber.^^As the guardian of this frozen prison, Thalassa stands vigilant, her presence a testament to the enduring power of the Elemental Queens. With her children, the Undines, at her side, she watches over the sea and the frost-bound realms, ensuring that the Frost Queen remains shackled and subdued, her icy magic contained within the depths of her watery domain."

selectmonster "Queen of the Deeps"
descr "In the annals of Elysium's ancient lore, Bathusma, Queen of the Deeps, stands as one of the three Elemental Queens of Water, born from the primordial depths of the Elemental Plane of Water at the Dawn of Time. Revered as the progenitors of all elemental beings, these queens embody the essence of their element, each representing a unique aspect of its power.^^Bathusma, with her dominion over the abyssal depths, commands reverence and awe. Known for her wisdom and enigmatic nature, she holds sway over the dark seas that shroud the ocean's deepest recesses. In the shadowed depths where light dare not penetrate, Bathusma reigns supreme, her realm a sanctuary for the secrets and mysteries of the watery depths.^^Yet, amidst her solemn rule, Bathusma harbors a secret of profound consequence. Though she maintains an air of mystery, she bears the burden of knowledge - the hidden location of the Frost Queen's icy prison. As a loyal sister to Thalassa, the Warden of the Sea, Bathusma aided in the sealing of the Frost Queen within the 'Cage of Divinity', a prison wrought by the combined might of the Elemental Queens.^^Deep within the fathomless abyss of Thalassa's watery kingdom lies this clandestine prison, concealed from mortal eyes and guarded by the forces of the sea. Bathusma, with her keen insight and ancient wisdom, stands as a keeper of this dark secret, ensuring the Frost Queen remains shackled and subdued, her icy magic contained within the depths of her sister's domain. With her children, the Living Waters, at her side, she watches over the abyss, ever vigilant in her duty to safeguard the imprisoned Frost Queen, their eldest sister and the most powerful of the four Elemental Queens."

selectmonster "Queen of the Lake"
descr "In the annals of Elysium's ancient lore, Limne, Queen of the Lake, stands as one of the three Elemental Queens of Water, born from the primordial depths of the Elemental Plane of Water at the Dawn of Time. Revered as the progenitors of all elemental beings, these queens embody the essence of their element, each representing a unique aspect of its power.^^Limne, with her dominion over the tranquil waters of lakes and rivers, commands admiration and reverence. Known for her gentle and benevolent nature, she holds sway over the serene beauty that graces the land. In the shimmering waters where life teems and nature flourishes, Limne reigns as a guardian of peace and harmony, her realm a sanctuary for all who dwell within it.^^Yet, amidst her peaceful rule, Limne harbors a secret of profound consequence. Though she embodies tranquility, she bears the weight of responsibility - the knowledge of her eldest sister's imprisonment. As a faithful ally to Thalassa and Bathusma, Limne aided in the sealing of the Frost Queen within the 'Cage of Divinity', a prison wrought by the combined might of the Elemental Queens.^^Deep within the crystalline waters of her sister's domain lies this clandestine prison, concealed from mortal eyes and guarded by the forces of the sea. Limne, with her compassionate heart and unwavering resolve, stands as a keeper of this solemn secret, ensuring the Frost Queen remains shackled and subdued, her powerful frost magic contained. With her children, the Undines, at her side, she watches over the tranquil waters, ever vigilant in her duty to safeguard the imprisoned Frost Queen, their eldest sister and the most powerful of the four Elemental Queens."

descr "For many years, the origins of the bizarre and unnatural creatures that roamed the swamps were shrouded in mystery. Learned scholars once speculated that these monstrosities were born from the very swamps themselves, as if the murky waters had somehow become alive, boiling and churning out twisted lifeforms. Some believed the swamps harbored strange magical properties, but none could explain the uniformity of the creatures or the sheer number that appeared to multiply without reason.^^That was until whispers spread and rumors turned to truth: a colossal, enigmatic creature dwelled deep within the most remote and treacherous swamps. This hulking being, now known as the 'Mother of Monsters,' was not just another creature, but the very source of the swamp's unholy population. Towering over the waters, her grotesque form produces offspring at an alarming rate, each more twisted and terrifying than the last. It is said that she breathes life into the darkest, vilest aspects of the swamp, warping nature itself.^^Despite her terrifying power, few have ever seen the Mother of Monsters, and even fewer have lived to tell the tale. Her very presence corrupts the land around her, and the closer one gets, the more unnatural the world becomes. She has become a living legend, the heart of the swamp, birthing nightmare after nightmare. To this day, even the most experienced swamp dwellers avoid her domain, fearing the relentless tide of creatures she continues to spawn from her bloated form. Thus, the swamp's true origin is revealed: not a natural force of nature, but the offspring of a terrible matron whose brood threatens to overrun the world."

descr "Among the mystical ranks of Elysium’s spellcasters, the Earthshapers are unique for their ability to manipulate the very land beneath their feet. Trained in the ancient and formidable school of Geomancy, Earthshapers have the rare ability to manipulate the terrain to their will, shaping the earth to serve strategic purposes. Initially, they possess a foundational understanding of Geomancer magic, capable of subtle manipulations such as raising barriers or altering paths. However, with further time, study, and experience, an Earthshaper can unlock the deeper mysteries of the earth, ascending to the revered level of Geomancer Mastery.^^Frequently sought after by powerful lords and organizations, Earthshapers are often employed to sculpt the land, creating or removing obstacles to aid in defense or invasion. Whether they are raising hills, diverting rivers, or leveling forests, their influence over the battlefield can be the difference between victory and defeat. They are particularly beloved by the dwarves, who prize their ability to raise new hills and mountains — prime territory for the dwarves to inhabit and cultivate for their mining operations. This symbiotic relationship has made Earthshapers highly esteemed among the dwarven clans, with some even living among the dwarves for long periods to aid in the expansion of their underground kingdoms."

descr "While being one of the basic units in the undead army, the Soulless were also the original workers in the necromantic manufacturies of the Markgraf.  Though slow and sluggish, they worked both day and night, thus earning good money for their proprietor.  Among the first batches it was noted however, that the undead Hoburgher would still stop for second or third breakfasts even without needing to eat more than the occasional brain."

descr "Assembled bones, regardless of size, seem to have an affinity for walking about. Boredom or forgetfulness are possible but unsatisfactory explanations for independently moving skeletal remains. If boredom was the cause, the bones of the giants of old should be more prevalent. Having spent millennia buried in the ground would likely be unimaginably boring. However, through necromantic rituals the bones of trolls and other giants sometimes appear where least expected, such as at the gates of the Markgraf's fortified hoburg."

descr "Unburied dead can be put to use by those who know the Dark Arts.  A fresh corpse makes a more sturdy vessel than the naked bones of the Longdead, but is still susceptible to holy energies.  While not as common as necromantically independent Longdead, there are Soulless that appear near cemeteries and haunted cities, regardless of the presence Necromancers.  The Dementia Theory suggests that independent Soulless are less common because the flesh of the newly dead is a greater repository for memories and the flesh is commonly the part of the body that experienced the process of the dying.  Thus the post-mortem dementia has less effects on a body less decomposed and spontaneous Soulless are less common than spontaneous Longdead."

However, while the Necromancers aim to salvage parts after a battle, the Nekromants are instead working on making an “autochurning Esmeralda” by fusing several undead together.  So far their abominations have mainly managed to churn a handful of Nekromant Apprentices to death before falling apart."

descr "Humans are not the only race that have problems with their bones starting to wander after having been dead for a long time.  The beasts have the same problem, but to a somewhat lesser extent.  It is believed that boars enjoy eating skeletal remains and thus leaves little left to become bored and walk again.  Many necromancers find it useful to reanimate beasts as they are usually stronger than humans and when dead they are equally stupid.  Reanimating the bones requires taxing incantations and much manual work and is probably best left to the eager apprentice."

descr "Humans are not the only race that have problems with their bones starting to wander after having been dead for a long time.  The beasts have the same problem, but to a somewhat lesser extent.  It is believed that boars enjoy eating skeletal remains and thus leaves little left to become bored and walk again.  Many necromancers find it useful to reanimate beasts as they are usually stronger than humans and when dead they are equally stupid.  Reanimating the bones requires taxing incantations and much manual work and is probably best left to the eager apprentice."

descr "Reanimating a newly dead animal might seem like a good idea. Animals are strong and when reanimated they also become capable of following simple orders. The big drawback is that the stench of the rotting animals is unbearable and it will be impossible to use the dead beast for any tasks that are close to civilization. Thus the wise necromancer uses animals that have been dead for ages and only have bones left."

This enigmatic entity wields the sublime power of solar magic with absolute mastery, and its very existence testifies to the astounding depths of celestial power that can be harnessed.

#startitem "Pocket Lich"
descr "In the mystical world of Elysium, the Abyssal Sovereign of Destruction embodies an entity of unmatched power in both necromancy and destructive magic. This divine Archlich has transcended mortal limitations, ascending to a godly state, wielding the forces of death and cataclysm in tandem. The Abyssal Sovereign's formidable presence is accentuated by its flowing black robe, a garment of dark majesty that sways like an omen of impending doom. Its hollow eye sockets blaze with eerie, ethereal flames, and its visage bears an eternal, ageless quality. Four resplendent wings, as black as the abyss, sprout from its back, evoking an image of an otherworldly harbinger."

classdescr "In the ages long before the arrival of man, Elysium was graced by beings of tremendous power who roamed the land, the unchallenged lords of the yet-unnamed realm. Yet, the echoes of an encroaching Ice Age heralded a time of great change. As the frigid embrace of winter tightened its grip on Elysium, these beings, the Sleeping Ones, chose to withdraw into the earth to slumber, seeking respite from the icy tempest that threatened to engulf their world. ^^ In their somnolence, the Sleeping Ones awaited an unknown destiny. But as time passed and the Ice Age rescinded, new inhabitants ventured into their realm, disturbing the tranquility of these ancient beings, sometimes inviting their wrath. It was amid this tumultuous backdrop that the Witches emerged, drawing upon mystic arts to serve the Frost Queen, the embodiment of winter's majesty. ^^ A supremely powerful Witch can use her enigmatic powers to pierce through the plane of Elysium and contact the Frost Queen. Forming a covenant with the powerful Diety of Frozen Majesty, and gaining new powers and followers as a result. ^^ The beings at the Witch's disposal are physically strong and easy to obtain, but most lack ranged attacks.  Archers are a crucial supplement.  The Witch's ability to collect fungi from forests, jungles, and swamps provides her with excellent scouting capabilities.  The more fungi she uses for summoning monsters, the greater the chance of controlling the summoned creature. It is prudent to use plenty of fungi when summoning an Old One, for they are very dangerous if angered."
classabdescr "Witches collect fungi from forests, Jungles and marshes.^Witches can use fungi to perform magic rituals.^Witch's Apprentices can use the surrounding swamps and marshes to recruit Androphags which can then be upgraded at a Citadel.^Poison Archers and Lizard Cavalry can also be recruited by also spending fungi.^Powerful Witches can form covenants with the Frost Queen, the Icy Diety beyond the realms of Elysium, gaining power, allies, snow movement and water breathing."

descr "Just like knights hunt the Fire Dragons in our part of the realm, barbarians in the northern wastes will try to hunt down their fabled Frost Dragons. In stark contrast to the Fire Dragon's diet of bold knights, the northern barbarians are less of a treat for the Frost Dragons. This is most likely due to their custom of smearing themselves with thick layers of rancid seal blubber to protect against the cold. The Frost Dragon’s lair is often found by observing a large amount of dead warriors frozen solid in various poses.^^This particular Frost Dragon was bred by the Frost Queen and is indeed one of her pets, as unfathomable as that is to believe. Some say these Dragons have frozen even their ability to age and have gained the ability regenerate minor wounds."

#descr "On rare occasions, a dwarf is born with a curiosity that reaches beyond the confines of their mountain home. These dwarves possess a unique blend of practicality and intuition, making them ideal candidates for the role of a Surveyor. Selected by the queen herself, a Dwarf Surveyor is tasked with venturing beyond the familiar tunnels and into the uncharted lands of Elysium. Their mission is to uncover new sources of minerals and assess potential sites for new mines. Armed with a keen eye for geology and an innate sense of direction, Surveyors are regarded with a mix of admiration and suspicion by their kin. While their solitary journeys are often long and arduous, the Surveyors play a vital role in the expansion and prosperity of dwarven society. Their findings can lead to the discovery of untold riches or the founding of new dwarven colonies, ensuring the continued survival and growth of their kind."
